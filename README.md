# WhatsAppX

## Purpose of the Extension
WhatsApp Messenger, while widely used for communicating with friends and businesses, lacks the convenience of initiating contact with numbers not already in your contact list from websites and other online platforms. WhatsAppX, a Chrome extension, addresses this gap by streamlining the process of adding phone numbers and social media usernames directly to WhatsApp from Chrome.

## Introduction
WhatsAppX is a user-friendly Chrome extension designed to enhance your WhatsApp experience. It simplifies the task of connecting with new contacts encountered online, be it for personal communication or professional collaboration.

## Features
- **Phone Number Detection**: Automatically detects phone numbers on web pages, providing a quick and easy way to initiate WhatsApp conversations.
- **One-Click Functionality**: Seamlessly links detected phone numbers to WhatsApp, allowing users to start chats with just a single click.
- **Toggle Switch**: Offers the ability to toggle the extension on or off, giving users control over its functionality.

## Installation
To install WhatsAppX:
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file from GitHub.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable 'Developer Mode' in the top right corner.
4. Choose 'Load unpacked' and select the directory where you cloned or extracted the extension.
5. WhatsAppX is now installed and ready for use.

## Usage
